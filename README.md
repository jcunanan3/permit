Moving truck parking permit application

When you use a moving truck in San Francisco, you generally need to reserve some curb space near your residence for parking. Currently, you have to call the SFMTA and order a reserved parking sign with a credit card. With this application, you can submit a request online to an MTA officer. The application will email you when the MTA has dispositioned your request. You can also pay for the permit online. 

The MTA officer can see a list of all pending permits as well as a map with all of the locations described so that he can plan enforcement.
